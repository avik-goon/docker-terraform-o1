Hereâ€™s a structured SQL questionnaire based on your schemas, with three difficulty levels:  

---

### **Low Difficulty**  
1. Retrieve all records from the `yellow_taxi_trip` table.  
2. Get the total number of trips recorded in the `yellow_taxi_trip` table.  
3. Find the total fare amount collected from all trips.  
4. List unique `payment_type` values from the `yellow_taxi_trip` table.  
5. Retrieve trips where `passenger_count` is greater than 3.  
6. Find trips where `trip_distance` is exactly 0.  
7. Display the top 5 most expensive trips based on `total_amount`.  
8. Retrieve all trips that used `RatecodeID = 2`.  
9. Find the number of trips where `store_and_fwd_flag` is 'Y'.  
10. Get the total number of unique `PULocationID` values in the `yellow_taxi_trip` table.  

---

### **Medium Difficulty**  
11. Find the average `trip_distance` for all trips.  
12. Find the highest `tip_amount` given for a trip.  
13. Get the top 3 pickup locations (`PULocationID`) with the most trips.  
14. Retrieve all trips that had a `total_amount` greater than 50 but a `tip_amount` of 0.  
15. Find the percentage of trips where `payment_type` is 2 (credit card).  
16. Display trips where the trip took longer than 1 hour.  
17. Find trips where `fare_amount` is greater than `total_amount` (potential data issue).  
18. List the total number of trips grouped by `RatecodeID`.  
19. Retrieve trips where `trip_distance` is more than 10 miles, but `fare_amount` is less than 15.  
20. Find the number of trips per vendor (`VendorID`).  

---

### **Hard Difficulty**  
21. Get the top 5 drop-off locations (`DOLocationID`) with the highest average fare.  
22. Find the day with the highest number of trips.  
23. Retrieve the number of trips for each borough by joining `yellow_taxi_trip` with `zone` (using `PULocationID = LocationID`).  
24. Calculate the average trip duration in minutes for each `RatecodeID`.  
25. Find the total amount earned from tips for each vendor (`VendorID`).  
26. Identify the pickup zone with the highest average `tip_amount`.  
27. Find the percentage of trips where `tip_amount` was more than 20% of `fare_amount`.  
28. Get the average `fare_amount` per borough.  
29. Identify trips where the `trip_distance` is above the 95th percentile.  
30. Find the top 3 most expensive trips where `trip_distance` is less than 2 miles.

4. Find all trips where the pickup and drop-off locations belong to the same borough.  
5. Get the total fare collected from each borough based on the drop-off location.  
6. Retrieve all trips where the pickup zone name is 'JFK Airport'.  
7. Find all trips where the drop-off zone is 'LaGuardia Airport'.  
8. Get the number of trips that started in the 'Manhattan' borough.

10. List the top 3 most common pickup zones.  

---

## **Medium Difficulty**  
11. Find the total number of trips that started in 'Brooklyn' and ended in 'Manhattan'.  
12. Get the average fare amount for each borough (based on pickup location).

15. Get the most frequent `payment_type` for each borough based on pickup location.  
16. List all trips where the pickup and drop-off locations belong to different boroughs.  
17. Find the total amount collected (`total_amount`) for each borough based on drop-off location.  
18. Identify trips where the pickup location is in 'Queens' but the drop-off is in 'Bronx'.  
19. Retrieve the total number of trips grouped by `service_zone`.  
20. Find the average trip duration in minutes for each pickup borough.  

---

## **Hard Difficulty**  
21. Identify the borough with the highest average `total_amount` per trip.  
22. Retrieve the top 3 zones with the highest percentage of cash payments (`payment_type = 1`).  
23. Find the borough with the most trips that had a tip amount greater than $10.  
24. Calculate the percentage of trips where the drop-off location was in the same borough as the pickup location.  
25. Retrieve the busiest pickup zone in terms of total trips per hour.  
26. Find the borough with the longest average trip distance.  
27. Identify pickup zones where the total `tip_amount` exceeds $5,000.  
28. Calculate the median `fare_amount` for trips grouped by borough (pickup location).  
29. Find the busiest borough based on the total number of trips for each day of the week.  
30. Get the average `trip_distance` and `total_amount` for each pickup zone, sorted by the highest earnings.

All these questions require `JOIN` operations between `yellow_taxi_trip` and `zone` using `PULocationID = LocationID` or `DOLocationID = LocationID`.  

Would you like me to provide SQL queries for these? ðŸš€
