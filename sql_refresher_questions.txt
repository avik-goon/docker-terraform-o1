You're absolutely right! I should have included more `JOIN`-based questions, especially since you provided two schemas. Here's an improved set of questions with proper `JOIN` operations across both tables.

## **Low Difficulty**  
1. Retrieve all pickup locations along with their corresponding borough names.  
2. Get a list of all drop-off zones along with their boroughs.  
3. Retrieve the total number of trips for each borough based on the pickup location.  
4. Find all trips where the pickup and drop-off locations belong to the same borough.  
5. Get the total fare collected from each borough based on the drop-off location.  
6. Retrieve all trips where the pickup zone name is 'JFK Airport'.  
7. Find all trips where the drop-off zone is 'LaGuardia Airport'.  
8. Get the number of trips that started in the 'Manhattan' borough.  
9. Retrieve the average trip distance for each borough based on pickup location.  
10. List the top 3 most common pickup zones.  

---

## **Medium Difficulty**  
11. Find the total number of trips that started in 'Brooklyn' and ended in 'Manhattan'.  
12. Get the average fare amount for each borough (based on pickup location).  
13. Retrieve the top 5 pickup zones with the highest average `tip_amount`.  
14. Find the drop-off zones where the total collected fare is greater than $10,000.  
15. Get the most frequent `payment_type` for each borough based on pickup location.  
16. List all trips where the pickup and drop-off locations belong to different boroughs.  
17. Find the total amount collected (`total_amount`) for each borough based on drop-off location.  
18. Identify trips where the pickup location is in 'Queens' but the drop-off is in 'Bronx'.  
19. Retrieve the total number of trips grouped by `service_zone`.  
20. Find the average trip duration in minutes for each pickup borough.

## **Hard Difficulty**  
21. Identify the borough with the highest average `total_amount` per trip.  
22. Retrieve the top 3 zones with the highest percentage of cash payments (`payment_type = 1`).  
23. Find the borough with the most trips that had a tip amount greater than $10.  
24. Calculate the percentage of trips where the drop-off location was in the same borough as the pickup location.  
25. Retrieve the busiest pickup zone in terms of total trips per hour.  
26. Find the borough with the longest average trip distance.  
27. Identify pickup zones where the total `tip_amount` exceeds $5,000.  
28. Calculate the median `fare_amount` for trips grouped by borough (pickup location).  
29. Find the busiest borough based on the total number of trips for each day of the week.  
30. Get the average `trip_distance` and `total_amount` for each pickup zone, sorted by the highest earnings.

All these questions require `JOIN` operations between `yellow_taxi_trip` and `zone` using `PULocationID = LocationID` or `DOLocationID = LocationID`.  

Would you like me to provide SQL queries for these? ðŸš€
